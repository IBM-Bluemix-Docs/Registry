# Monitoring the vulnerability of images
{: #registry_ui}

You can view information about potential vulnerabilities, and the security of images in the {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} public and private repositories by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.
{:shortdesc}

The **SECURITY REPORT** column shows you the following information about the image:
-   `Secure` No security issues were found.
-   `Vulnerable` Security or configuration issues were found and must be addressed before you can deploy the image.
-   `Incomplete` The scan is not complete. The scan might still be running or the imageâ€™s operating system might not be compatible. Wait and try the scan again. If the scan still does not complete, push the image again to start a new scan. Images with incomplete scans are not blocked for deployment.
-   `Unsupported OS` The operating system in the image is not supported.

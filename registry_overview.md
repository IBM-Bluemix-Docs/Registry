# About {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}
{: #registry_overview}

Use {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} to safely store and access private Docker images in a highly available and scalable architecture.
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} provides a multi-tenant, highly available, and scalable private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM. You can use the private registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing Docker images to your namespace.

<img src="images/registry_architecture.png" alt="Image showing how you can interact with IBM Cloud Container Registry. Container Registry contains both private and public repositories, and APIs to interact with the service. Your local Docker client can pull and push images to and from your private repositories in the registry, and can pull public repositories. The IBM Cloud web UI (console) interacts with Container Registry API to list images. The Container Registry CLI interacts with the API to list, create, inspect, and remove images, as well as other administrative functions. Your local Docker client can also pull and push images from your local image store to other registries."/>

**Figure 1. How {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} interacts with your Docker images**

A Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a Dockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the app's configuration, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, only users with access to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account can access your images.

When you push images to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.

Review the following table to find an overview of benefits for using {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}.

## Service plans
{: #registry_plans}

You can choose between the free or standard {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} service plans to store your Docker images and make these images available to users in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.
{:shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} service plan determines the amount of storage and pull traffic that you can use for your private images. The service plan is associated with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account, and limits for storage and image pull traffic apply to all namespaces that you set up in your account.

The following table shows available {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} service plans and their characteristics. For more information about how billing works and what happens when you exceed service plan limits, see [Quota limits and billing in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}](#registry_plan_billing).

|Characteristics|Free|Standard|
|---------------|----|--------|
|Description|Try out the private registry in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} to safely store and share your Docker images. This plan is the default service plan when you set up your first namespace in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}.|Benefit from unlimited storage and pull traffic usage to manage the Docker images for all namespaces in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.|
|Amount of storage for images|500 MB|Unlimited|

## Quota limits and billing
{: #registry_plan_billing}

Find information and examples for how the billing process and quota limits work in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

Every image is built from a number of layers that each represent an incremental change from the base image. When you push or pull an image, the amount of storage and pull traffic that is needed for each layer is added to your monthly usage. Identical layers are automatically shared between images in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account and are reused when you create other images. The storage for each identical layer is charged only once, regardless of how many images in your account reference the layer.

Example for pushing images:

> You push an image to your namespace that is based on the Ubuntu image. The Ubuntu image contains several layers. Because you do not have these layers in your account yet, the amount of storage that these layers require is added to your monthly usage.
>
> Later, you create a second image that is based on the Ubuntu image. You change the Ubuntu base image, such as by adding additional commands or files to your Dockerfile. Each change represents a new image layer. When you push the second image, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} recognizes that all layers of the base Ubuntu image are already stored in your account. You are not charged for storing these layers a second time, even if you pushed your image to another namespace. {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} determines the size of all new layers and adds the amount of storage to your monthly usage.

### Billing for storage and pull traffic
{: #registry_billing_traffic}

Depending on the service plan that you choose, you are charged for the storage and pull traffic that you use per month.
{:shortdesc}

**Storage:**

  Every {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} service plan comes with a certain amount of storage that you can use to safely store your Docker images in the namespaces of your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. If you are on the standard plan, you are charged by GB-Months of usage. The first 0.5 GB-Months are free. If you are on the free plan, you can store your images in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} for free until you reach the quota limits for the free plan. A GB-Month is an average of one 1GB of storage for a month (730 hours).

  Example for the standard plan:

  > You use 5 GB for exactly half the month and then you push several images to your namespace and use 10 GB for the rest of the month. Your monthly usage is calculated as follows:
  >
  > (5 GB x 0.5 (months)) + (10 GB x 0.5 (months)) = 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 GB-Months
  >
  > In the standard plan, the first 0.5 GB-Months are free, so you get charged for 7 GB-Months (7.5 GB-Months - 0.5 GB-Months).

  

**Pull traffic:**

  Every {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} service plan includes a certain amount of free pull traffic to your private images that are stored in your namespace. Pull traffic is the bandwidth that you use when you pull a layer of an image from your namespace to your local machine. If you are on the standard plan, you are charged by GB of usage per month. The first 5 GB each month is free. If you are on the free plan, you can pull images from your namespace until you reach the quota limit for the free plan.

  Example for the standard plan:

  > In the month, you pulled images that contain layers with a total size of 14 GB. Your monthly usage is calculated as follows:
  >
  > In the standard plan, the first 5 GB per month is free, so you get charged for 9 GB (14 GB - 5 GB).

  

### Quota limits for storage and pull traffic
{: #registry_quota_limits}

Depending on the service plan that you choose, you can push and pull images to and from your namespace until you reach your plan-specific or custom quota limits.
{:shortdesc}

**Storage:**

  When you reach or exceed the quota limits for your plan, you cannot push any images to the namespaces in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account until you either [free up space by removing images](registry_quota.html#registry_quota_freeup) from your namespaces, or [upgrade to the standard plan](#registry_plan_upgrade). If you set quota limits for storage in your free or standard plan, you can also [increase this quota limit](registry_quota.html#registry_quota_set) to enable the pushing of new images again.

  Example for the standard plan:

  > Your current quota limit for storage is set to 1 GB. All private images that are stored in the namespaces of your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account already use 900 MB of this storage. You have 100 MB storage available until you reach your quota limit. One user wants to push an image with a size of 2 GB on the local machine. Because the quota limit is not yet reached, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} allows the user to push this image.
  >
  > After the push, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} determines the actual size of the image in your namespace, which can vary from the size on your local machine, and checks whether the limit for storage is reached. In this example, the storage usage increases from 900 MB by 2 GB. With your current quota limit set to 1 GB, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} prevents you from pushing additional images to the namespace.

**Pull traffic:**

  When you reach or exceed the quota limits for your plan, you cannot pull any images from the namespaces in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account until you either wait for the next billing period to start, [upgrade to the standard plan](#registry_plan_upgrade), or [increase your quota limits for pull traffic](registry_quota.html#registry_quota_set).

  Example for the standard plan:

  > In the month, your quota limit for pull traffic is set to 5 GB. You already pulled images from your namespaces and used 4.5 GB of this pull traffic. You have 0.5 GB pull traffic available until you reach your quota limit. One user wants to pull an image from your namespace with a size of 1 GB. Because the quota limit is not yet reached, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} allows the user to pull this image.
  >
  > After the image is pulled, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} determines the bandwidth that you used during the pull and checks whether the limit for pull traffic is reached. In this example, the pull traffic usage increases from 4.5 GB to 5.2 GB. With your current quota limit set to 5 GB, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} prevents you from pulling images from your namespace.

### Estimating costs
{: #registry_estimating_costs}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} pricing calculator to estimate the cost of your plan.
{:shortdesc}

You can price your app by using the cost calculators that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

1.  Open the pricing sheet, see [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Pricing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/pricing).
2.  In the **Pay As You Go** section, click **Estimate your costs with our calculator**. The calculator opens.
3.  Scroll to the **Container Registry** section in the **Container Charges** section.
4.  Enter your storage and traffic estimates in the fields provided.

Your estimated costs are displayed in the calculator.

## Upgrading your service plan
{: #registry_plan_upgrade}

You can upgrade your service plan to benefit from unlimited storage and pull traffic usage to manage the Docker images for all namespaces in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.
{:shortdesc}

If you want to find out what service plan you have, run the `bx cr plan` command.

1.  Log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

    ```
    bx login
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Note**: If you have a federated ID, use `bx login --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.

2.  Upgrade to the standard plan.

    ```
    bx cr plan-upgrade standard
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Note:** If you have an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Trial account, you must upgrade to an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Standard account before running `bx cr plan-upgrade`.


## Learning the basics

{:shortdesc}

### Understanding the terms used in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}
{: #terms}


<dl>
  <dt>Registry</dt>
  <dd>A registry is a service that provides the infrastructure to store Docker images and that can be accessed by using the registry host URL and an optional port. Registries can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} provides a multi-tenant, highly available private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM. You can use the private registry by setting up your own image namespace and start pushing Docker images to your namespace.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Namespace</dt>
  <dd>Namespaces are a way to organize repositories of your images within {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}. The namespace is associated with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. When you set up your own namespace in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, the namespace is appended to the registry URL as follows: <code>registry.<em>&lt;region&gt;</em>.bluemix.net/my_namespace</code>.

  Every user in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account can view and work with images that are stored in your registry namespace. You can set up multiple namespaces, for example, to have separate repositories for your production and staging environments.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Repository</dt>
  <dd>An image repository is a collection of related, tagged images in the registry. Repository is often used interchangeably with image, but a repository potentially holds multiple tagged variants of an image.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Image</dt>
  <dd>A Docker image is built based on the instructions given in the Dockerfile and represents the basis of a container. After the Docker image is built, you can use it to create a container to deploy your app and its dependencies. Images are stored in a registry. Users with access to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account can access your images.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Tag</dt>
  <dd>A tag is an identifier of an image within a repository. You can use tags to distinguish different versions of the same base image within a repository. When you run a Docker command and do not specify the tag of a repository image, then the image tagged <code>latest</code> is used by default.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Dockerfile</dt>
  <dd>A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions to build a Docker image. Typically, an image is built upon a base image that contains a base operating system, such as Ubuntu. You can incrementally change the base image with your Dockerfile instructions to define the environment that the app needs to run. Every change to the base image describes a new layer of the image, and you can make multiple changes in a single Dockerfile line. The instructions in a Dockerfile also might reference build artifacts that are stored separately, such as an app, the app's configuration, and its dependencies.</dd>
</dl>

To learn more about Docker-specific terms, [consult the Docker glossary](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/).

### Planning Namespaces
{: #registry_namespaces}

{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} provides a multi-tenant private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM. You can safely store and share your Docker images in this registry by setting up a registry namespace.
{:shortdesc}

You can set up multiple namespaces, for example, to have separate repositories for your production and staging environments. If you want to use the registry in multiple {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions, you must set up a namespace for each region. Namespace names are unique within regions. You can use the same namespace name for each region, unless someone else already has a namespace with that name set up in that region.

To work with the IBM-provided public images only, you do not need to set up a namespace.

**Note:** If you are unsure whether a namespace is already set for your account, run the `bx cr namespace-list` command to retrieve existing namespace information. If you are an existing {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} customer that uses [single and scalable container groups](../../containers/cs_classic.html), you already have a namespace. You can create additional namespaces, but cannot run `cf ic namespace set` for more than one namespace.

Consider the following rules when you choose a namespace:

-   Your namespace must be unique in an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region.
-   Your namespace must be 4 - 30 characters long.
-   Your namespace must start with at least one letter or number.
-   Your namespace must contain lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores (_) only.

After you set your first namespace, you are assigned the free {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} service plan if you have not already [upgraded your plan](#registry_plan_upgrade).

## Regions
{: #registry_regions}

{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} registries are available in several regions.
{:shortdesc}

### Local regions
{: #registry_regions_local}

A region is a geographic area that is accessed by a dedicated endpoint. {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} registries are available in the following regions:

-   ap-south: `registry.au-syd.bluemix.net`
-   eu-central: `registry.eu-de.bluemix.net`
-   uk-south: `registry.eu-gb.bluemix.net`
-   us-south: `registry.ng.bluemix.net`

All registry artifacts are scoped to the specific regional registry that you are currently working with. For example, namespaces, images, tokens, quota settings, and plan settings must all be managed separately for each regional registry.

If you want to use a region other than your local region, you can target the region that you want to access by running the `bx cr region-set`  command. You can run the command with no parameters to get a list of available regions, or you can specify the region as a parameter.

To run the command with parameters, replace _&lt;region&gt;_ with the name of the region, for example, `eu-central`.

```
bx cr region-set <region>
```
{: pre}

For example, to target the eu-central region, run the following command:

```
bx cr region-set eu-central
```
{: pre}


### Global registry
{: #registry_regions_global}

A global registry is available, which has no region that is included in its name (`registry.bluemix.net`). Only IBM-provided public images are hosted in this registry. To manage your own images such as by setting up namespaces or tagging and pushing images to a registry, use a [local regional registry](#registry_regions_local).
{:shortdesc}

You can target the global registry by running the `bx cr region-set` command.

For example, to target the global registry, run the following command:

```
bx cr region-set global
```
{: pre}

For more information about the `bx cr region-set` command, see [{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} CLI](../../cli/plugins/registry/index.html#bx_cr_region_set).

After you have targeted the global registry, run the `bx cr login` command to log your local Docker daemon into the global registry so that you can pull {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-provided public images.

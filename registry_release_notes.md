## 25 February 2019
{: #25feb2019}

<dl>
  <dt>New domain names</dt>
  <dd>{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} is adopting new domain names. The new domain names are available in the console and the CLI. You can use the new `icr.io` domain names now. The existing `registry.bluemix.net` domain names are deprecated, but you can continue to use them until the end of support date. An end of support date is not available yet. For more information, see [Regions](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_overview#registry_regions) and [Introducing New IBM Cloud Container Registry Domain Names ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/introducing-new-ibm-cloud-container-registry-domain-names).

  Signatures apply to the whole image name, which includes the domain name. If you are using content trust, you must add new signatures so that you can consume content trust under the new domain name. For more information about signing images, see [Signing images for trusted content](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_trustedcontent#registry_trustedcontent).</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>IAM API key pull secrets for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters</dt>
  <dd>The new cluster image pull secrets for the `icr.io` domains are authorized by using an {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) API key. Therefore, if you want more control over access to your {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} resources, you can add IAM policies. For example, you can change the API key policies in the cluster's pull secret so that images are pulled from a certain registry region or namespace only.
  
  For more information, see [Understanding how your cluster is authorized to pull images from {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-images#cluster_registry_auth).</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>New region in ap-north</dt>
  <dd>A new region is available in `ap-north`. You can use the new region by using the domain name `jp.icr.io`.
  
  For more information, see [Regions](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_overview#registry_regions).</dd>
</dl>

## 21 February 2019
{: #21feb2019}

<dl>
  <dt>Automating access to your namespaces</dt>
  <dd>Using tokens to automate pushing and pulling Docker images to and from your namespaces is deprecated. You must now use API keys to automate access to your {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} namespaces so that you can push and pull images.

  For more information, see [Automating access to your namespaces by using API keys](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_access#registry_api_key).</dd>
</dl>

## 8 January 2019
{: #8jan2019}

 <dl>
  <dt>End of support for Vulnerability Advisor API version 2</dt>
  <dd>Vulnerability Advisor’s API version 2 is deprecated and is no longer usable.

  For more information, see [Vulnerability Advisor v2 API Deprecation ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-archive/2018/12/vulnerability-advisor-v2-api-deprecation/).</dd>
</dl>

## 4 October 2018
{: #4oct2018}

<dl>
  <dt>Managing user access</dt>
  <dd>Use {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM) to control access by users in your account to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}. When IAM policies are enabled for your account in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, every user that accesses the service in your account must be assigned an access policy with an IAM user role defined. That policy determines what role the user has within the context of the service, and what actions the user can perform.

  For more information, see [Managing user access with {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}}](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-iam#iam), [Defining user access role policies](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-user#user), and [Tutorial: Granting access to IBM Cloud Container Registry resources](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-iam_access#iam_access).</dd>
</dl>

## 7 August 2018
{: #7aug2018}

<dl>
  <dt>Exemption policies available in Vulnerability Advisor</dt>
  <dd>If you want to manage the security of an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} organization, you can use your policy setting to determine whether an issue is exempt or not. You can use Container Image Security Enforcement to ensure that deployment is allowed only from images that contain no security issues after accounting for any issues that are exempted by your policy.

  For more information, see [Setting organizational exemption policies](/docs/services/Registry?topic=va-va_index#va_managing_policy).</dd>
</dl>

## 25 July 2018

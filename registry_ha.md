# High availability and disaster recovery
{: #ha-dr}

The {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} service is a highly available, regional, service.
{:shortdesc}

* In each supported region, traffic is load balanced across registry infrastructure in multiple availability zones, with no single point of failure.

* Data that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} is replicated and it is also backed up regularly.

* If you are worried about the availability of your images if an entire region is unavailable, you can choose to push your images to multiple regional registries.
  
  You might also choose to push your images to multiple registries in case you accidentally delete or overwrite your images.

  For more information about regions, see [Regions](/docs/Registry?topic=registry-registry_overview#registry_regions).

##Â Frequently asked questions about high availablility and disaster recovery
{: #ha-dr_faq}
  
### Does the service replicate the data?
{: #ha-dr_replicate_data}

All customer data in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} is replicated and backed up. Backups include service and policy settings and image data, but not vulnerability results, which can be reconstructed. All data, including vulnerability results, is replicated within each region so that the loss of a single availability zone is tolerated transparently. Additionally, point-in-time backups are used by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to restore the content in the event of data corruption, and out-of-region backups are used by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to restore the service in a disaster recovery situation.

### Do users have to replicate the data?
{: #ha-dr_client}

You are not expected to replicate your images, however, if you want to do so, you can create a service instance in another {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} region and choose from a range of tooling options, including pushing to multiple locations from your development pipeline, and the use of replication tools, such as [`skopeo copy`](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/master/docs/skopeo-copy.1.md){: external}. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not replicate service instances.

### What data is backed-up or replicated?
{: #ha-dr_backup}

The service and policy settings and image data are backed up by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}.

### Does {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} replicate the service?
{: #ha-dr_service}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not replicate the instance of the service, which your account created, from one region to another region.

### Do users have to replicate the service?
{: #ha-dr_service_replicate}

You are not required to replicate the instance of the service, which your account created in one region, to another region, but you do have the option to do it yourself by using tools such as [`skopeo copy`](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/master/docs/skopeo-copy.1.md){: external}.

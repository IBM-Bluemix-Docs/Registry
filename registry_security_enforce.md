# Enforcing container image security (beta)
{: #security_enforce}

With IBM Container Image Security Enforcement (beta), you can verify your container images before you deploy them to your cluster in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}. You can control where images are deployed from, enforce Vulnerability Advisor policies, and ensure that [content trust](registry_trusted_content.html) is properly applied to the image. If a pod does not meet your policy requirements, your cluster is not modified.
{:shortdesc}

IBM Container Image Security Enforcement gets the information about image content trust and vulnerabilities from {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}. You can choose whether to block or allow images from other registries in your policies, but you cannot use vulnerability or trust enforcement for these images.

Your {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} cluster [autorecovery](../../containers/cs_health.html#autorecovery) system might be affected by IBM Container Image Security Enforcement. For example, if a node goes down, then its workload is scheduled to a new node. If Vulnerability Advisor detects a new vulnerability since your image was first deployed, Security Enforcement prevents the scheduler from creating the new pod.
{:tip}

## Installing Container Image Security Enforcement in your cluster
{: #sec_enforce_install}

Before you begin:
* [Create](../../containers/cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui) or [update](../../containers/cs_cluster_update.html) the cluster that you want to use with **Kubernetes version 1.9 or later**.
* [Target your `kubectl` CLI](../../containers/cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster.

1.  Install the <a href="https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm" target="_blank">Helm CLI <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.

1.  Configure Helm in your cluster. Helm installs Tiller into your cluster if it is not installed already.

    ```
    helm init
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  Add the IBM chart repository to your Helm.

    ```
    helm repo add ibm-incubator https://registry.bluemix.net/helm/ibm-incubator
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  Install the IBM Container Image Security Enforcement Helm chart into your `ibm-system` cluster namespace. Give it a name such as `<cise>`.

    ```
    helm install --name=<cise> --namespace=ibm-system ibm-incubator/ibmcloud-image-enforcement
    ```
    {: pre}

IBM Container Image Security Enforcement is now installed, and is applying the [default security policy](#default_policies) for all Kubernetes namespaces in your cluster. For information about customizing the security policy for Kubernetes namespaces in your cluster, or the cluster overall, see [Customizing policies](#customize_policies).

## Default policies
{: #default_policies}

IBM Container Image Security Enforcement installs some policies by default to provide you with a starting point for building your security policy.
{:shortdesc}

To override these policies:
* Write a new policy document and apply it to your cluster by using `kubectl apply`, or
* Edit the default policy by using `kubectl edit`

For more information about writing security policies, see [Customizing policies](#customize_policies).

### Cluster-wide policy
{: #cluster-wide}

By default, a cluster-wide policy enforces that all images in all registries have trust information and have no reported vulnerabilities in Vulnerability Advisor.
{:shortdesc}

**Default cluster-wide policy `.yaml` file**:

```yaml
apiVersion: securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: ibmcloud-default-cluster-image-policy
spec:
   repositories:
    # This enforces that all images deployed to this cluster pass trust and VA
    # To override, set an ImagePolicy for a specific Kubernetes namespace or modify this policy
    - name: "*"
      policy:
        trust:
          enabled: true
        va:
          enabled: true
```

When you set `va` or `trust` to `enabled: true` for a container registry other than {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, any attempts to deploy pods from images in that registry are denied. If you want to deploy images from other registries, remove the `va` and `trust` policies.
{:tip}

### Kube-system policy
{: #kube-system}

By default, a namespace-wide policy is installed for the `kube-system` namespace. This policy allows all images from any container registry to be deployed into the `kube-system` without enforcement. It also allows repositories used to configure your cluster.
{:shortdesc}

**Default `kube-system` policy `.yaml` file**:

```yaml
apiVersion: securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: ibmcloud-image-policy
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
   repositories:
    # This policy allows all images to be deployed into this namespace. This policy prevents breaking any existing third party applications in this namespace.
    # IMPORTANT: Review this policy and replace it with one that meets your requirements. If you do not run any third party applications in this namespace, you can remove this policy entirely.
    - name: "*"
      policy:
    # These policies allow all IBM Cloud Container Service images from the global and all regional registries to deploy in this namespace.
    # IMPORTANT: When you create your own policy in this namespace, make sure to include these repositories. If you do not, the cluster might not function properly.
    - name: "registry*.bluemix.net/armada/*"
      policy:
    - name: "registry*.bluemix.net/armada-worker/*"
      policy:
    - name: "registry*.bluemix.net/armada-master/*"
      policy:
```

### IBM-system policy
{: #ibm-system}

By default, a namespace-wide policy is installed for the `ibm-system` namespace. This policy allows all images from any container registry to be deployed into the `ibm-system` without enforcement. It also allows repositories used to configure your cluster, and to install or upgrade Image Security Enforcement.
{:shortdesc}

**Default `ibm-system` policy `.yaml` file**:

```yaml
apiVersion: securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: ibmcloud-image-policy
  namespace: ibm-system
spec:
   repositories:
    # This policy allows all images to be deployed into this namespace. This policy prevents breaking any existing third party applications in this namespace.
    # IMPORTANT: Review this policy and replace it with one that meets your requirements. If you do not run any third party applications in this namespace, you can remove this policy entirely.
    - name: "*"
      policy:
    # These policies allow all IBM Cloud Container Service images from the global and all regional registries to deploy in this namespace.
    # IMPORTANT: When you create your own policy in this namespace, make sure to include these repositories. If you do not, the cluster might not function properly.
    - name: "registry*.bluemix.net/armada/*"
      policy:
    - name: "registry*.bluemix.net/armada-worker/*"
      policy:
    - name: "registry*.bluemix.net/armada-master/*"
      policy:
    # This policy prevents Image Security Enforcement from blocking itself
    - name: "registry*.bluemix.net/ibm/ibmcloud-image-enforcement"
      policy:
    # This policy allows Image Security Enforcement to use Hyperkube to configure your cluster. This policy must exist if you uninstall Image Security Enforcement.
    - name: quay.io/coreos/hyperkube
      policies:
```

## Customizing policies
{: #customize_policies}

You can change the policy that IBM Container Image Security Enforcement uses to permit images, either at the cluster or Kubernetes namespace level. In the policy, you can specify different enforcement rules for different images.
{:shortdesc}

You must have some policy set. Otherwise, deployments to your cluster fail. If you do not want any image security policies enforced, [remove security enforcement](#remove).
{:tip}

When you apply a deployment, Container Image Security Enforcement checks whether the Kubernetes namespace that you are deploying to has a policy to apply. If it does not, Container Image Security Enforcement uses the cluster-wide policy. Your deployment is denied if no namespace or cluster-wide policy exists.

Before you begin, [target your `kubectl` CLI](../../containers/cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster.

1.  Create a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/" target="_blank">Kubernetes custom resource definition <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> `.yaml` file.

1.  Apply the `.yaml` file to your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f <filepath>
    ```
    {: pre}

### Specifying trusted content signers in custom policies
{: #signers}

If you use content trust, you can verify that images are signed by particular signers. Deployment is allowed only if the latest signed version is signed by all the listed signers. To add a signer to a repository, see [Managing trusted signers](registry_trusted_content.html#trustedcontent_signers).
{:shortdesc}

To configure the policy to verify that an image is signed by a particular signer:

1.  Get the signer name (the name that was used in `docker trust signer add`), and the signer's public key.
1.  Generate a Kubernetes secret with the signer name and their public key.
    ```
    kubectl create secret generic <secret_name> --from-literal=name=<signer_name> --from-file=publicKey=<key.pub>
    ```
1.  Add the secret to the `signerSecrets` list for the repository in your policy.
    ```yaml
    - name: example
      policy:
        trust:
          enabled: true
          signerSecrets:
          - name: <secret_name>
    ```

## Controlling who can customize policies
{: #assign_user_policy}

If you have role-based access control (RBAC) enabled on your Kubernetes cluster, you can create a role to govern who has the ability to administer security policies on your cluster. For more information about applying RBAC rules to your cluster, see [the IBM Cloud Container Service docs](../../containers/cs_users.html#rbac).
{:shortdesc}

In your role, add a rule for security policies:
```yaml
- apiGroups: ["securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com"]
  resources: ["imagepolicies", "clusterimagepolicies"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

You can create multiple roles to control what actions users can take. For example, change the `verbs` so that some users can only `get` or `list` policies. Alternatively, you can omit `clusterimagepolicies` from the `resources` list to grant access only to Kubernetes namespace policies.
{:tip}

Users who have access to delete custom resource definitions (CRDs) can delete the resource definition for security policies, which also deletes your security policies. Make sure to control who is allowed to delete CRDs. To grant access to delete CRDs, add a rule:

```yaml
- apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1"]
  resources: ["CustomResourceDefinition"]
  verbs: ["delete"]
```

**Note**: Users and ServiceAccounts with the `cluster-admin` role have access to all resources. The cluster-admin role grants access to administer security policies, even if you do not edit the role. Make sure to control who has the `cluster-admin` role, and grant access only to people that you want to allow to modify security policies.

## Deploying container images with enforced security
{: #deploy_containers}

When a policy is applied, you can deploy content to your cluster normally. Your policy is automatically enforced by the Kubernetes cluster. If your deployment matches a policy and is allowed by that policy, your deployment is accepted by the cluster and applied.
{:shortdesc}

If Container Image Security Enforcement denies a Deployment, the Deployment is created, but the ReplicaSet created by it fails to scale up, and no pods are created. You can find the ReplicaSet by running `kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>`, and then see the reason that the deployment was denied by running `kubectl describe rs <replicaset-name>`.

**Sample error messages**:

*  If your image does not match any policies, or there are no policies in the namespace or the cluster.

   ```
   admission webhook "trust.hooks.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com" denied the request: Deny, no image policies or cluster polices for <image-name>
   ```
   {: screen}

*  If your image matches a policy but does not satisfy that policy's Vulnerability Advisor requirements.

   ```
   admission webhook "va.hooks.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com" denied the request: The Vulnerability Advisor image scan assessment found issues with the container image that are not exempted. Refer to your image vulnerability report for more details by using the command `bx cr va`.
   ```
   {: screen}

*  If your image matches a policy but does not satisfy that policy's trust requirements.

   ```
   admission webhook "trust.hooks.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com" denied the request: Deny, failed to get content trust information: No valid trust data for latest
   ```
   {: screen}

*  If your policy specifies trust enforcement for your image, but your image is not from a supported registry.

   ```
   admission webhook "trust.hooks.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com" denied the request: Trust is not supported for images from this registry
   ```
   {: screen}

You can enable the `va` option in your policy to enforce that Vulnerability Advisor passes before an image can be deployed. Images that are not supported by Vulnerability Advisor are allowed.

You can enable the `trust` option in your policy to enforce content trust. If you do not specify any `signerSecrets`, the deployment is allowed if the image is signed by anyone. If you specify `signerSecrets`, the most recently signed version of the image must have been signed by all the signers you specify. IBM Container Image Security Enforcement verifies that the provided public key belongs to the signer. For more information about content trust, see [Signing images for trusted content](registry_trusted_content.html).

A deployment is allowed only if all images pass the IBM Container Image Security Enforcement checks.

## Removing Container Image Security Enforcement
{: #remove}

Before you begin, [target your `kubectl` CLI](../../containers/cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster.



1.  Disable Container Image Security Enforcement.

    ```
    $ kubectl delete MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-admission-config
    $ kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration image-admission-config
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2.  Remove the resource definitions for your security policies. When you delete the resource definitions, your security policies are also deleted.

    ```
    kubectl delete crd clusterimagepolicies.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com imagepolicies.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com
    ```
    {: pre}

3.  Remove the chart.

    ```
    helm delete --purge cise
    ```
    {: pre}
